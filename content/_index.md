Hi! My name is Fabio, I'm a computer scientist and currently acting as a data engineer. Currently I'm working at Pi investimentos and, before that, I've worked in a startup from Norway called Fitsmind, acting as a full-stack software engineer.

Excited about new challenges and trying keep this website updated.

Current based in Sao Paulo. If you're here, let's get a coffee! :)
