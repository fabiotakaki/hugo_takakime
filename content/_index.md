Hi, I’m Fabio!!

I’m a computer scientist with a strong background in software and data engineering. Currently, I work as a **Staff Software Engineer at Rubcube**, where I lead the architecture and development of scalable financial platforms and data solutions. My recent work includes building a white-label digital banking system used by over 10 digital banks and developing cloud-native data engineering pipelines.

Previously, I worked at Toro Investimentos designing data lakes, ETL pipelines, and machine learning solutions to support financial decision-making. I also had the opportunity to join FitsMind, a Norwegian startup, as a full-stack developer early in my career.

I’m passionate about building scalable systems, solving complex problems, and leading technical teams. This site is a space where I share thoughts, technical insights, and side projects, when I have a minute to breathe.

Currently based in Tubarão - Santa Catarina.
If you’re around, let’s grab a coffee! <3
